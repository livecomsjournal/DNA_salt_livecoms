G-quadruplex structures are non-canonical secondary structures formed by both DNA and RNA. G-quadruplexes regulate a wide range of important biochemical processes. Besides the sequence requirements, the coordination of monovalent cations in the GQ is essential for its formation and determines the stability and polymorphism of GQ structures. The nature, location, and dynamics of the cation coordination and their impact on the overall GQ stability are dependent on several factors such as the ionic radii, hydration energy, and the bonding strength to the O6 of guanines. The intracellular monovalent cation concentration and the localized ion concentrations determine the formation of GQs and can potentially dictate their regulatory roles. A wide range of biochemical and biophysical studies on an array of GQ enabling sequences have generated at a minimum the knowledge base that allows us to often predict the stability of GQs in the presence of the physiologically relevant metal ions, however, prediction of conformation of such GQs is still out of the realm.},

Encouragingly, the addition of a single V2 term involving the atoms C(sp3)-O-(sp3)-C(sp3)-N(sp2), which can be nicely rationalized because of the anomeric effect (lone pairs on oxygen are preferentially oriented relative to the electron withdrawing N), brings the sugar pucker phase of C2’-endo sugars to near perfect agreement with ab initio calculations (W near 162 degrees). Secondly, the use of high level ab initio calculations on entire nucleosides (in contrast to smaller model systems necessitated in 1994-95 by computer limitations) lets one improve the chi torsional potential for nucleic acids. Finally, the O(sp3)-C(sp3)- C(sp3)-O(sp3) V2 torsional potential has been empirically adjusted to reproduce the ab initio calculated relative energy of C2’-endo and C3’-endo nucleosides. These modifications are tested in molecular dynamics simulations of mononucleosides (to assess sugar pucker percentages) and double helices of DNA and RNA (to assess helical and sequence specific structural properties). In both areas, the modified force field leads to improved agreement with experimental data.},

In this study, we have carried out four unrestrained ≈1 ns length MD trajectories in aqueous solution on the DNA duplex d(CCAACGTTGG)2, two beginning in a canonicalA-DNA structure and two beginning in a canonicalB-DNA structure. As judged by root-mean-squared coordinate deviations, average structures computed from all four of the trajectories converge to within ≈0.8 to 1.6 Å (all atoms) of each other, which is 1.3 to 1.7 Å (all atoms of the central six residues from each strand) and 3.1 to 3.6 Å (all atoms) away from theB-DNA-like X-ray structure reported for this sequence. To our knowledge, this is the first example of multiple nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectories with full representation of DNA charges, solvent and long range electrostatics that demonstrate both internal consistency (two different starting structures and four different trajectories lead to a consistent average structure) and considerable agreement with the X-ray crystal structure of this sequence and NMR data on duplex DNA in aqueous solution. This internal consistency of structure for a given sequence suggests that one can now begin to realistically examine sequence-dependent structural effects in DNA duplexes using molecular dynamics.},

  Abstractnote             = {The utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model biomolecular structure, dynamics, and interactions has witnessed enormous advances in recent years due to the availability of optimized MD software and access to significant computational power, including GPU multicore computing engines and other specialized hardware. This has led researchers to routinely extend conformational sampling times to the microsecond level and beyond. The extended sampling time has allowed the community not only to converge conformational ensembles through complete sampling but also to discover deficiencies and overcome problems with the force fields. Accuracy of the force fields is a key component, along with sampling, toward being able to generate accurate and stable structures of biopolymers. The Amber force field for nucleic acids has been used extensively since the 1990s, and multiple artifacts have been discovered, corrected, and reassessed by different research groups. We present a direct comparison of two of the most recent and state-of-the-art Amber force field modifications, bsc1 and OL15, that focus on accurate modeling of double-stranded DNA. After extensive MD simulations with five test cases and two different water models, we conclude that both modifications are a remarkable improvement over the previous bsc0 force field. Both force field modifications show better agreement when compared to experimental structures. To ensure convergence, the Drew–Dickerson dodecamer (DDD) system was simulated using 100 independent MD simulations, each extended to at least 10 μs, and the independent MD simulations were concatenated into a single 1 ms long trajectory for each combination of force field and water model. This is significantly beyond the time scale needed to converge the conformational ensemble of the internal portions of a DNA helix absent internal base pair opening. Considering all of the simulations discussed in the current work, the MD simulations performed to assess and validate the current force fields and water models aggregate over 14 ms of simulation time. The results suggest that both the bsc1 and OL15 force fields render average structures that deviate significantly less than 1 Å from the average experimental structures. This can be compared to similar but less exhaustive simulations with the CHARMM 36 force field that aggregate to the ∼90 μs time scale and also perform well but do not produce structures as close to the DDD NMR average structures (…},

  Abstractnote             = {We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.},

The analysis is based on the use of curvilinear helicoidal coordinates and leads to highly localized ion densities compared to those obtained by simply superposing molecular dynamics snapshots in Cartesian space. The results identify highly populated and sequence-dependent regions where ions strongly interact with the nucleic and are coupled to its conformational fluctuations. The data from this approach is presented as ion populations or ion densities (in units of molarity) and can be analyzed in radial, angular and longitudinal coordinates using 1D or 2D graphics. It is also possible to regenerate 3D densities in Cartesian space. This approach makes it easy to understand and compare ion distributions and also allows the calculation of average ion populations in any desired zone surrounding a nucleic acid without requiring references to its constituent atoms. The method is illustrated using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations for two different DNA oligomers in the presence of 0.15 M potassium chloride. We discuss the results in terms of convergence, sequence-specific ion binding and coupling with DNA conformation.},

  Abstractnote             = {Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization strategy based on a restrained ensemble-maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field, which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.},

Depending on conditions in the fibres, molecules in the C form may pack in either a hexagonal or anorthorhombiclattice; these conditions (e.g. water content and salt content) are discussed. Techniques used in analysing partly-disordered diffraction patterns are described. The C configuration consists of a non-integral helix with about 9⅓ residues in a pitch of 31Å; the base pairs are moved from their positions in the B model by 1·5 Å in such a direction that the narrow groove is made deeper, and are tilted by 6°. The configuration of a single nucleotide is essentially the same as in B: only the position and orientation of the nucleotides within the helix have been altered. Packing of smooth double helices in orthorhombic and hexagonal lattices is discussed, and the conclusions are applied to the packing of C molecules.},

  Abstractnote             = {We present here the parmbsc0 force field, a refinement of the AMBER parm99 force field, where emphasis has been made on the correct representation of the alpha/gamma concerted rotation in nucleic acids (NAs). The modified force field corrects overpopulations of the alpha/gamma = (g+,t) backbone that were seen in long (more than 10 ns) simulations with previous AMBER parameter sets (parm94-99). The force field has been derived by fitting to high-level quantum mechanical data and verified by comparison with very high-level quantum mechanical calculations and by a very extensive comparison between simulations and experimental data. The set of validation simulations includes two of the longest trajectories published to date for the DNA duplex (200 ns each) and the largest variety of NA structures studied to date (15 different NA families and 97 individual structures). The total simulation time used to validate the force field includes near 1 mus of state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations in aqueous solution.},

Specifically, we have explored the population of Na(+) in the minor groove of DNA duplex, and whether or not a string of Na(+) can replace the spine of hydration in the narrow AATT minor groove. The results suggest that the insertion of Na(+) in the minor groove is a very rare event, but that when once the ion finds specific sites deep inside the groove it can reside there for very long periods of time. According to our simulation the presence of Na(+) inside the groove does not have a dramatic influence in the structure or dynamics of the duplex DNA. The ability of current MD simulations to obtain equilibrated pictures of the counterion atmosphere around DNA is critically discussed.},

The A-form is induced locally in some protein–DNA complexes, and repeated transitions between the B- and A-forms have been proposed to generate the forces used to drive dsDNA into viral capsids during genome packaging. Here, we report analyses on previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on B-DNA, along with new MD simulations on the transition from A-DNA to B-DNA in solution. We introduce the A-B Index (ABI), a new metric along the A-B continuum, to quantify our results. When A-DNA is placed in an equilibrated solution at physiological ionic strength, there is no energy barrier to the transition to the B-form, which begins within about 1 ns. The transition is essentially complete within 5 ns, although occasionally a stretch of a few base pairs will remain A-like for up to ∼10 ns. A compari...},

Comparison with the experiment showed that while some features of fraying are consistent with the available data, others indicate potential problems with the force field description. In particular, multiple noncanonical structures are formed at the ends of the DNA and RNA duplexes. Among them are tWC/sugar edge pair, C?H edge/Watson?Crick pair, and stacked geometries, in which the terminal bases are stacked above each other. These structures usually appear within the first tens to hundreds of nanoseconds and substantially limit the usefulness of the remaining part of the simulation due to geometry distortions that are transferred to several neighboring base pairs (?end effects?). We show that stability of the noncanonical structures in ff99bsc0 may be partly linked to inaccurate glycosidic (?) torsion potentials that overstabilize the syn region and allow for rapid anti to syn transitions. The RNA refined glycosidic torsion potential ?OL3 provides an improved description and substantially more stable MD simulations of RNA molecules.

  Abstractnote             = {Z-DNA duplexes are a particularly complicated test case for current force fields. We performed a set of explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with various AMBER force field parametrizations including our recent refinements of the ε/ζ and glycosidic torsions. None of these force fields described the ZI/ZII and other backbone substates correctly, and all of them underpredicted the population of the important ZI substate. We show that this underprediction can be attributed to an inaccurate potential for the sugar-phosphate backbone torsion angle β. We suggest a refinement of this potential, βOL1, which was derived using our recently introduced methodology that includes conformation-dependent solvation effects. The new potential significantly increases the stability of the dominant ZI backbone substate and improves the overall description of the Z-DNA backbone. It also has a positive (albeit small) impact on another important DNA form, the antiparallel guanine quadruplex (G-DNA), and improves the description of the canonical B-DNA backbone by increasing the population of BII backbone substates, providing a better agreement with experiment. We recommend using βOL1 in combination with our previously introduced corrections, εζOL1 and χOL4, (the combination being named OL15) as a possible alternative to the current β torsion potential for more accurate modeling of nucleic acids.},
